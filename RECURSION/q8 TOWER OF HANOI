Solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. There are three pegs, say A, B and C. The peg A has n disks (each of different size)
attached to it. The disks are arranged in decreasing order of size, with the smallest on top.
The objective is to move these disks to the peg C, while following the given rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time

Only the topmost disk of a peg can be moved

A moved disk can be placed only on the top of the disks on any peg

No disk can be placed above a disk smaller than itself

Input Description : A singleline containing an integer,n, the number of disks at A before the game starts.

Expected output
As many number of lines as the number of possible movements of disks between all pairs
of pegs until all of them are moved to C with each line containing output in the following format, followed
by a line containing the number of movements
"source_peg -> dest_peg disks_at_A disks_at_B disks_at_C"
Ex:
Input:
3
Output:
A -> C 2 0 1
A -> B 1 1 1
C -> B 1 2 0
A -> C 0 2 1
B -> A 1 1 1
B -> C 1 0 2
A -> C 0 0 3
