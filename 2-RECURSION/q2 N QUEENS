Solve the N - Queens problem. 

You are expected to place N queens on an NN chess board such that none of the queens can attack the
others i.e. they do not share the same row, column or diagonal.
Assume the chess board to be a grid with rows and columns both going from 0 to N - 1

Input Description : A single line containing an integer,N , the size of the grid and the number of queens.
You can assume that 1<N<12

Expected output: As many lines as the number of possible non-attacking configurations with each line
containing N integers where ith integer represents the non-attacking cell of the ith
row followed by a line containing single integer representing the number of such configurations.

Ex:
for N=4, there are only two possible configurations to place queens in non-attacking positions, which
are following-
0  1  0  0
0  0  0  1
1  0  0  0
0  0  1  0
0  0  1  0
1  0  0  0
0  0  0  1
0  1  0  0
Cells containing 1s correspond to the positions of the queens
Note:
Refer to this example to understand the output format, as described above, for the sample input
assuming 0-based indexing.

Input:
4
Output:
1 3 0 2
2 0 3 1
2
