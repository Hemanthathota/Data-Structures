/*
Calculate the determinant of a given square matrix of integers.

Input Description: 
First line of the input will contain a single integer N, followed by N lines,the rows of the matrix, each containing N
integers.

Note:
You can assume that 1<N<10 and elements of the matrix
will fit into 32-bit signed integer whereas determinants will fit into 64-bit signed integer.

Expected Output:
A single line containing an integer, i.e. the
determinant
of the matrix
example:
Input:
4
1   2   3    4
3   4   5
