Implement the following sorting algorithms:
(a) Selection Sort
(b) Bubble Sort
(c) Insertion Sort
(d) Merge Sort
(e) Quick Sort
implement all the algorithms in a single file called q2_sort.c and use them for both Question 2 and Question3.
Input
t number of test cases n, number of elements in the array
The n array elements

Expected Output:
For each test-input there will be 5 output lines and each containing the array elements sorted in ascending
order by each of the algorithms in sequence from a to e. For every test-input write the six space separated
values per line to a file named out2.txt with the first being the array size and rest being the times(in microsecond)
taken by each of the algorithms, in the above mentioned sequence, to sort the array.
Note:
Finally generate a single plot showing the "array-size vs Sorting-time" graph for all five algorithms.
Script will be provided to complete this part.
