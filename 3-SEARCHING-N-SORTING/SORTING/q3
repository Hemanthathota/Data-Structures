Use all the sorting algorithms implemented in Question 2 to complete this
Input:
t, number of test-inputs
n, size of the array
n unsorted array elements elements n sorted array elements in ascending order n sorted array elements in descending order

Expected Output:
For every test-input, write 4 space separated values to files named as out3_bubble.txt, out3_insertion.txt
and so on, for each algorithm run on all three arrays. First of 4 values must be the array size and next three
being the times(microseconds) taken by the algorithms to run on the three arrays in the specified order.

Note:
Script will be provided to plot the graphs
