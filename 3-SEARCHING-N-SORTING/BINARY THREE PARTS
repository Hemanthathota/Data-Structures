Implement Binary Search in the following three ways, where the array is partitioned as:
1.  1/2 and 1/2
2.  1/3 and 2/3
3.  Three parts of 1/3 size each
Input
n, the number of elements in the array
The n array elements k, the key to be searched

Output :

The position (array index) of the key in the array, if the key is present;  or print -1 to indicate the key is
absent in the array
The number of comparisons to be made for each of these three cases, comma separated
