/*
1. Implement Abstract Data Type(ADT) Complex Number and associated operations
on them.
Implement following operations on complex numbers.
(a) Addition of two Complex Numbers
(b) Subtraction of two Complex Numbers
(c) Multiplication of two Complex Numbers
(d) division of two Complex Numbers
(e) Modulus/Magnitude/Absolute value of a Complex Number
Note: Write separate functions for each operation. Function corresponding to Modulus operation
must return a floating point value precise upto 6 digits after decimal and functions
corresponding to rest of the operations must return a Complex Number. Upon execution,
your program must present the user with an options-menu with option numbers (starting
from 1) for each of the operations and a sentinel-value (-1 or 0) to terminate the program.
Your program must prompt the user to enter two complex numbers, one in each line, followed
by the choice of operation and repeat this until user decides to terminate the program.
ex
Addition:
1
Subtraction: 2
Multiplication: 3
Division: 4
Modulus: 5
Input:
0 1
2 3
1
Output: 2 + 4i
